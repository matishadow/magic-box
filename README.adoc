Some people say:

> The best things in life come in small packages (:gem:).

*_NO!_*

> The best things in life come in highly secure packages :lock:!

And when being in settled down age of 28 :birthday:, such things are exactly what you need.

Oh, you know what. I take it back.
There are no best things in the box, they're average at best.
You can keep them though, happy birthday!!! :gift:

== Why it's locked?
It's locked to prevent other people from getting the contents.
(Obviously.)
Only you are mighty enough to open this mighty box.

== :unlock: How to open
You have received the box, so it's your box.
And you should know how to open _your_ box.

=== In case you forgot how to open
Use protruding cables to provide your PIN code. :electric_plug:

=== In case you forgot your PIN code
That's too bad, try brute-forcing it or something.

=== In case you really want to brute force opening it here are some tips

* Your Raspberry Pi is all set. To SSH into it just:
  . Power it on.
  . Connect it to your router using Ethernet cable.
  . Check your router to know what's the IP of your Raspberry Pi.
  . Log in using `pi:raspberry` credentials.
* To control voltages on Raspberry's pins either use
  https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/python/README.md[this python library]
  or http://wiringpi.com/the-gpio-utility[this command line tool].
* Cables have the following meanings:
  ** image:https://via.placeholder.com/15/ff0000/000000?text=+[] 5V Power supply
  ** image:https://via.placeholder.com/15/000000/000000?text=+[] Ground
  ** image:https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffff00/000000?text=+[] 0th bit of password digit
  ** image:https://via.placeholder.com/15/800080/000000?text=+[] 1st bit of password digit
  ** image:https://via.placeholder.com/15/ed7014/000000?text=+[] 2nd bit of password digit
  ** image:https://via.placeholder.com/15/654321/000000?text=+[] 3rd bit of password digit
  ** image:https://via.placeholder.com/15/32CD32/000000?text=+[] Synchronization clock
* To know meanings of the pins on Raspberry Pi you can use https://pinout.xyz/[this site].
* Arduino inside the box needs to be powered by Raspberry Pi.
  To do that connect the [red]#red cable# to 5V pin of Raspberry Pi,
  and [black]#black cable# to ground pin of Raspberry Pi.
* PIN code consists of 4 digits, it could be like `1234` or `5555`.
* 4 green LEDs shows correctly inputted PIN digits.
* To provide one PIN digit you need to:
  . Set Raspberry pin connected to [green]#green cable# to `HIGH`.
    It will also light the [yellow]#yellow LED# for two seconds.
  . Within these two seconds set digit pins to voltages representing a digit (from 0 to 9) for example:
    ** To send `4` set:
      *** image:https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffff00/000000?text=+[] -> `LOW`
      *** image:https://via.placeholder.com/15/800080/000000?text=+[] -> `LOW`
      *** image:https://via.placeholder.com/15/ed7014/000000?text=+[] -> `HIGH`
      *** image:https://via.placeholder.com/15/654321/000000?text=+[] -> `LOW`
    ** To send `9` set:
      *** image:https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffff00/000000?text=+[] -> `HIGH`
      *** image:https://via.placeholder.com/15/800080/000000?text=+[] -> `LOW`
      *** image:https://via.placeholder.com/15/ed7014/000000?text=+[] -> `LOW`
      *** image:https://via.placeholder.com/15/654321/000000?text=+[] -> `HIGH`
  . After two second Arduino will turn off the [yellow]#yellow LED# and *read the digit*.
  . Set Raspberry pin connected to [green]#green cable# to `LOW`.
* To provide a next digit just repeat the previous point.
* When you provide a wrong PIN digit, input process starts from the beginning.
* Read the Arduino code

* Good luck :four_leaf_clover:!
